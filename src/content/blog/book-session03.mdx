# Chapter 5: Tooling

## Automated Refactoring Tools

Thanks to IDEs, we use these tools in everyday coding without even noticing. They make our lives easier by quick fixes, refactors like re-naming, flatting if statements, creating inline returns and so much more.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing was first made possible with the production of `xUnit`. Originally it was written in `Smalltalk`, then it was ported to other languages like `C++` and `Java`.  
There are some unit testing frameworks for `Javascript` too:

- Jest
- Jasmine
- Cypress
- Mocha
- Storybook

# Chapter 6: I Don't Have Much Time And I Have To Change It

## Sprout Model

Pay now or pay more later.  
Sprout Model implies that we should add the new code as a new function or method.

```javascript
// Imagine we want to use the postDate method and add the entries that
// are not present in the bundle.

result = entries.map(entry => {
  entry.postDate();
});

transactionBundle = [...transactionBundle, ...result];
```

We could do it like:

```javascript
const result = entries
  .filter(entry => !transactionBundle.includes[entry])
  .map(entry =>
    entry.postDate();
);

transactionBundle = [...transactionBundle, ...result];
```

But in the scenario above we have mixed the legacy and new code together and we have created even more legacy code.  
The solution is to add the code as a function and then call it where it is needed:

```javascript
const entriesToAdd = uniqueEntries(entries);

result = uniqueEntries.map(entry => {
  entry.postDate();
});

transactionBundle = [...transactionBundle, ...result];
```

## Wrap Method

Imagine we have a function like:

```javascript
const pay = () => {
  // functionality blah blah
};
```

And we need to add a feature in which we log the data to be used later. And that on feature happens at the very same time as the `pay` function. One way is to add the feature right into the `pay` function but this is called `temporal coupling` and is very awful. One other way is to use `wrap method`:

```javascript {1}
const pay = () => {
  dispatchPay();
  logPay();
};

const dispatchPay = () => {
  // functionality blah blah
};

const logPay = () => {
  // log log log Zzz...
};
```

This technique has 2 issues:

- The new logic cannot be mixed with the old logic
- It results in bad names for variables and functions
